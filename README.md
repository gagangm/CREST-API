# CREST-API
A project on REST API, I worked on while I was a trainee software engineer in ShieldSquare.
This project's been developed in Python language with flask framework.
This project is also incorporated with JavaScript, HTML and CSS languages.
This project has used multiple packages from JavaScript and CSS.
This project's main goal was to provide Bot protection for the subscribed partner-users by our company but through partner side.
I have developed this project to cater the needs of the company I was working for at the time.
Please feel free to use it for any doubts, issues and research.
